/*
Third largest element
Given an array of distinct elements.
 Find the third largest element in it.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case is N, size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated values of the array a[].

Output:
Print the third largest element of the array. If the array has less than 3 elements print -1.

Your Task:
Complete the function thirdLargest() which takes the array a[]
and the size of the array, n, as input parameters and
returns the third largest element in the array.
It return -1 if there are less than 3 elements in the given array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105

Example:
Sample Input:
2
5
2 4 1 3 5
2
10 2

Sample Output:
3
-1

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Largest number is 5, followed by 4 and then 3. Hence, the answer is 3.
Test Case 2: Since there are less than 3 numbers, output is -1.     */
